# Learning

This is a learning repo created to play with new frameworks and libraries, most likely JS related activities. Building off a code challenge I worked up quickly for a prospective employer.

## Original Code Challenge Instructions

### Instructions
 * Respond with your attached completed solution at the end of the allotted 3 hour period
 * Use any languages, frameworks, or 3rd party libraries as you see fit
 * Get as far as you can through the challenge starting with the front-end experience of rendering and user interaction of the board
 * Let us know if you have any questions as you're attempting the challenge

### Bonus
 * Create a gallery of all boards which are viewable and editable by any user

### You will be judged on
 * Simplicity of solution
 * Best practices and idioms
 * Use of a framework or sensible data/view separation
 * Code quality, abstractions, and overall architecture
 * Look, feel, and UI embellishments
